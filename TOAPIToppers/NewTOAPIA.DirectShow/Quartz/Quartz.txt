This set of interfaces cover the quartz.dll file.

The Quartz library was originally intended to allow VB
programmers to access DirectShow.  It also provided a
simple scripting interface so that JScript could be used
to program simple scenarios for DirectShow as well.

This library can be used for very high level DirectShow
programming.  If you want access to lower level interfaces
you will have to use the DirectShow Editing Services (DES)
and other interfaces.

You can create a bare bones DirectShow application by using
nothing more than the IMediaControl interface that is implemented
here.
