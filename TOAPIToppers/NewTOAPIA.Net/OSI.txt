OSI Model

Open System Interconnection Reference Model

Layer 1: Physical Layer
Pins, voltages, cable specs, hubs, repeaters, network adapters, host bus adapters
Connection to physical medium
participate in process of sharing physical medium

Layer 2: Data Link Layer
Provides functional and procedural means to transfer data between network entities.
Detect and correct errors in physical layer
Creates frames
	MAC - Media Access Control
	LLC - Logical Link Control (IEEE 802.2)
	
Layer 3: Network Layer
Transferring variable length data sequences from sour to destination via one or more networks
Maintains quality of service requested by transport layer
Perform network routing functions
Perform fragmentation and reassembly
report delivery errors
Routers operate at this layer
Logical addressing scheme, values chosen by network engineer
Addressing scheme is hierarchical
IPv7? - iso 8473

Layer 4: Transport Layer
TCP
UDP

Layer 5: Session Layer
Controls the dialogues (connections) between computers.
Establishes, manages, and terminates the connections between the local and remote application
Provides full, half, simplex operation
establishes checkpointing, adjournment, termination and restart procedures
responsible for graceful close of sessions
commonly implemented in applications environments that use remote procedure call

Layer 6: Presentation Layer


Layer 7: Application Layer
